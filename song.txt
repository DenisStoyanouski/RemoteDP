[Verse 3]
Back attack the wack packs you faxing me
You don't want none, high quality action, be
Still standing, damaging your other manning
Quick reverse, potent as the first verse
My amplifier, blows on your world's higher
World sire, cuts like a barbed wire
Record player, I pull up on you everyday
Fast forward, I move and I swing toward
Exit load, put your brain in right mode
Select and mix, the man will perfect and fix
Heads lightly, bite me, copy, xerox
Cock sand blocks, you can't knocks, I'm out there
Upbeat, lifting, shifting
Persistent intelligent kingpin
Peeping astrology
As I roll with Prodigy, with diesel power

[Hook]
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantas-)
