Yo, I used to check out lyrics upon the formats
Built with skill with technique, computer ADAT
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought, flow, acrobat
Sync the track, pump the track
Dance missions clubs like spores react by strobe visions
And hurrying more reflects on the dance floor
Blowing up, and having mad people showing up
Packing crowds, jam packed venues
Needles collapse while atmosphere continues
Sprinkle that, win it like that, move it like that
Hitting like that, the melody is phat
Yo, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic boss with Prodigy
Flipping astrology
My intellects devour, with diesel power

Win, spin back, rewind, diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
It has to be, automatically, check it out
You'd better work it out, change to another route
My techniques, strategies, abilities
I leave cords to mics hanging like spring leaves
Doing tracks so fast, beyond the human eye
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
E's and pepped up, you get swept up
Smacked up, backed up, your crew's all cracked up
Check it, slow pitch, who's quick, you can't stick
My metaphor range is strange as angles
You get tangled, twist inside affections
Channels repeat, complete, can't compete
Check the hour texture, mind adventure
Exploit the point into tracks, to devour
My intellects proceed, with diesel power
